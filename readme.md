## Project overview:
The primary purpose of this demo app is to understand how SpringBoot cloud stream raises and publishes domain events.
And particularly on how to use @TransactionalEventListener as a callback mechanism to publish the events registered from the aggregate. 
 
This POC is adapted from the following tuto "https://dev.to/peholmst/knee-deep-in-spring-boot-transactional-event-listeners-and-cglib-proxies-1il9"
